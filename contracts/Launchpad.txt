the key functionalities and purposes of this smart contract are follow:

Presale Creation: The contract allows project owners (referred to as "sellers") to create token presales. There are two methods provided for 
creating presales: one for accepting BNB (Binance Coin) as payment and the other for accepting a specified ERC-20 token as payment. Sellers 
can set various parameters for the presale, including the token to be sold, metadata, price per token, start and end times, soft and hard 
caps, minimum and maximum investment amounts, and more.

Investment: Investors can participate in the presale by either sending BNB or ERC-20 tokens, depending on how the presale was set up. The 
contract handles the conversion of funds into tokens based on the specified price and ensures that the presale conditions are met.

Presale Management: Sellers can manage their presales by updating various parameters such as the start and end times, token price, minimum 
and maximum investments, and caps (soft and hard caps). They can also add more tokens to the presale if needed.

Closing Presale: Once the presale is complete or if the seller decides to end it prematurely, they can close the presale. This action 
returns any remaining tokens to the seller.

Token Withdrawal: Sellers can withdraw any remaining tokens from the contract after the presale is closed.

Address Tracking: The contract keeps track of addresses that have participated in the presale to prevent multiple purchases from the same 
address.

In summary, this smart contract serves as a decentralized launchpad for token presales, allowing project owners to raise funds from early 
investors in a secure and controlled manner. It automates the process of token distribution and investment tracking while providing 
flexibility in configuring the parameters of each presale.
