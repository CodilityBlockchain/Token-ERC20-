the main functionalities and purposes of this smart contract are follow:

Airdrop Initialization: Users can initialize a new airdrop by providing the contract with the address of the ERC-20 token they want to 
distribute, the total amount of tokens to distribute, and the amount of tokens each user should receive. This sets up the parameters for 
the airdrop.

Claiming Tokens: Users can claim their allocated tokens from the airdrop. The contract checks if the airdrop is active, if the user has 
already claimed tokens from it, and if there are enough remaining tokens to distribute. If all conditions are met, the user receives their 
allocated tokens.

Closing Airdrops: The user who initiated the airdrop can close it, making it inactive and preventing further claims. This can be useful to 
stop the distribution once the desired amount has been distributed.

Additional Token Deposits: The user who initiated the airdrop can also add more tokens to the airdrop if needed. This allows them to top up 
the airdrop with additional tokens in case they initially underestimated the amount required.

Platform Fees: The contract deducts a platform fee (specified as a percentage of the total tokens) and transfers it to the platformOwner 
(the contract deployer). This fee is taken when the airdrop is initialized.

Data Storage: The contract uses a data structure (airdropInfo) to store information about each airdrop, including the token contract, the u
ser who initiated it, the total amount, the remaining amount, and whether it's active. It also maintains a record of claimed tokens to 
prevent double claiming.

In summary, this smart contract is designed to automate the process of distributing ERC-20 tokens in an airdrop fashion, ensuring fairness, 
tracking claimed tokens, and allowing the airdrop initiator to manage and control the distribution process.
