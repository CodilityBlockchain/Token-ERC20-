The contract provides functionality for initializing and managing airdrop campaigns. Here are the key features and purposes of this 
smart contract:

Airdrop Initialization (initialize function): Users can initiate a new airdrop campaign by providing the address of the ERC-20 token 
they want to distribute, the total amount to distribute, and the amount to be distributed per user. The contract records the airdrop 
campaign's details, including the token, user, total amount, and remaining amount.

Claiming Airdrop (claim function): Users can claim their share of the airdrop by calling this function. They can only claim if the airdrop 
is active, they haven't already claimed from the same campaign, and there is a sufficient remaining amount. The claimed amount is 
transferred to the user, and their address is added to the list of claimants.

Closing Airdrop (closeAirdrop function): The user who initiated the airdrop campaign can use this function to close the airdrop. When closed, 
any remaining tokens are transferred back to the initiator's address.

Getting Airdrop Details (getAirdropDetails function): This function allows users to retrieve details about a specific airdrop campaign, 
such as the token, initiator, total amount, remaining amount, list of users who claimed, amount per user, and whether the airdrop is active.

Adding More Tokens (addMoreTokens function): The initiator of the airdrop can add more tokens to the campaign after it has started. This 
function increases both the total and remaining amounts of the airdrop.

Platform Fees: The contract deducts a platform fee (specified as a percentage) from the total airdrop amount and transfers it to the 
platform owner when a new airdrop is initialized.

This smart contract is designed to make it easy for a user to create, manage, and distribute tokens in a controlled manner to a 
group of recipients, such as in the context of promotional airdrops or token giveaways. It ensures fairness by enforcing rules like not 
allowing multiple claims from the same user and enabling the airdrop initiator to close the campaign if needed.
