It is to facilitate token presale events where users can purchase tokens at a specific price. The contract provides a platform for 
initiating and managing these presales. Here's an overview of the primary functions and purposes of this smart contract:

Initialization of Presales:
Users can call the initialize function to start a new presale event by specifying the token address, the amount of tokens to be sold, 
and the price per token.
A platform fee of 0.0001 ether is collected from the user who initializes the presale.

Token Purchases:
Users can buy tokens during an active presale by calling the buy function and providing the presale ID.
The contract checks if the presale is active and if the user sends enough ether to purchase the desired amount of tokens at the specified price.
Tokens are transferred to the buyer, and the remaining token amount in the presale is updated.
An event BUY is emitted to record the purchase.

Closing Presales:
Users who initialized a presale can close it by calling the closePresale function, which deactivates the presale and transfers any 
remaining tokens back to the presale creator.

Viewing Presale Details:
Users can query details of a specific presale by calling the getPresaleDetails function, which provides information about the token, 
presale creator, total token amount, remaining tokens, list of buyers, token price, and whether the presale is active.

Adding More Tokens:
The contract allows the presale creator to add more tokens to an active presale using the addMoreTokens function, which increases the total 
token amount and the remaining token balance.

The primary purpose of this smart contract is to create and manage token presale events, enabling users to purchase tokens at a specified 
price during the presale period. It also ensures the security of token transfers and platform fee collection, similar to the previous 
contract you provided.
